#Alchemeleon

Explore the lives of historical figures, modern notables, superstar corporations (are people too), and whomever else your heart desires!

Alchemeleon uses the [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/)'s Entity and Relation Extraction methods to dynamically generate game content in the form of storylines, characters, and environments. Players can assume the perspective of any other onscreen character by clicking on them.
